Make sure the alarm is on its final install location, then set the controller into the inclusion mode.3. Quickly, triple short the two sensing probes together with wet cloth, the LED will flash alternately.4. The LED will flash 3 times with beeping after the alarm being Add (included) to the network successfully.",

Quickly, triple short the two sensing probes together by wet cloth, the LED light will flash for 3 times with beeping sound.4. Wait for the controller to remove (excluded) the alarm.Note: If the alarm is remove(excluded), then the sensor will be itself restored to factory default settings.",
		"reset": "Restore the Sensor to Factory Default SettingsThis operation will delete all information on Z-Wave network, and restore the factory default settings. 1. Remove the battery, power off for a while. Now put on the battery. 2. Wait for 5 seconds, When the LED is on, you should short the two sensing probes together with wet cloth within 5 seconds (before the LED turn off), and then remove the wet cloth quickly . 3. Repeat the Step2 one times. 4. The sensor will sound after successful operation, and it will last 2 seconds.Note: If this sensor is reset, the information of Z-Wave network in the sensor will be deleted. The sensor will be itself restored to factory default settings.Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable."
