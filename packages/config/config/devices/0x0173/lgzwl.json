Tapping the button twice will send a simpler message to the hub which will not include the security command classes.Inclusion Legacy ModeIf your home automation hub does not support the Z-Wave Notification Command Class, the LGZWLD can substitute the simpler Binary Switch command class. To enable Legacy Mode, tap the Z-Wave button three times during inclusion. Virtually all hubs support the Binary Switch command class.",
