Step 2: On the SES 302, press the button, hold and release after 1 second to send a request (Network Information Frame) to join the network. On successful inclusion the LED will flash 2 times. The total process can take up to 20 seconds. If the LED flashes 4-times this means that the inclusion process has failed, so try moving the SES 302 to another position and repeat the Inclusion steps. If the inclusion process fails again, the device may be already included in another network. So first exclude and then include the device. The controller will show when the inclusion operation is successful",
