# Changelog (v1 to v5)

## 5.7.0 (2020-12-23)
### Config file changes
* Added Aeotec thermostatic Valve ZWA021
* Added Q-Light Puck and Zerodim 2pol
* Added Q-Light Zerodim
* Fixed wrong label and description for Z-Wave.Me UZB

### Bugfixes
* When a node does not respond because it is asleep, the corresponding transaction is no longer rejected and moved to the wakeup queue instead. This should restore the pre-5.0.0 behavior.
* Added missing label to Binary Sensor CC
* Added missing `%` unit to Battery level
* Timeouts when querying User Codes and the current Lock status are now ignored
* `User Code CC Reports` without a user code are no longer discarded when the user status is `Available`. This should improve compatibility with some non-compliant nodes
* The `targetValue` for the `Binary Switch`, `Multilevel Switch` and `Basic` CCs is now persisted in the Value DB when setting values through the API.

### Features
* Config files can now be used specify additional CCs that a node does not advertise in its NIF.
* Added support for fallback config files without a firmware version. These can be used to set some parameters for devices which wouldn't complete the `Version CC` interview otherwise

## 5.6.1 (2020-12-18)
### Config file changes
* Add Heiman Smoke detector
* New product ID for Fibaro Heat controller

* Added support for sending multicast and broadcast commands (non-secure only)

### Bugfixes
* `Driver.destroy()` no longer does anything after the first call
* `Sound Switch Tone Play Report` commands now parse the volume if it exists

* When encapsulating commands, the `secure` flag is now correctly propagated
* Fixed a bug where commands that belong to a different transaction could be mismatched, resulting in unexpected messages
* The mapping of root to endpoint 1 now works correctly if the node does not support `Multi Channel Association CC` at all
* When the `Multilevel Switch CC` level change commands indicate that Supervision is not supported, this is now remembered and the command gets retried without supervision.
* Removed some debug logging which could blow up the log file size
* `Notification CC Reports` are now parsed correctly when the `V1 Alarm` bytes are not zero
* `Color Switch CC`: Setting the **warm white** `targetValue` no longer falsely claims that the `propertyKey` is missing

  **WARNING:** The current signature is deprecated and will be changed in the next major version!
* Metadata can now be customized by CCs with the `ccSpecific` property. This is used in several CCs to allow applications to identify which value a value ID describes (e.g. sensor type, meter type, etc...)

### Bugfixes
* The logs of `ConfigurationCC::PropertiesGet` now include the correct *next parameter #*
* The `targetValue` of switch-type CCs is no longer overwritten with `undefined` when a report without target value is received

* Multi Channel Lifeline Associations are no longer created automatically if the device does not support the `Multi Channel CC`
* Fixed an issue where marking nodes with active transaction as asleep would mess up the serial communication with the controller
* The receiver of an S0 nonce is now stored and after a successful reply, all nonces for said issuer are now invalidated
* Unsuccessful controller commands now return the response message instead of throwing

### Changes under the hood
* The log messages for unsuccessful controller commands no longer claim that the controller did not respond

  * The `CCAPI` type is now exported
  * `NODE_ID_BROADCAST` and `NODE_ID_MAX` are now value exports
  * The `Endpoint` class is now exported
  * The `InterviewStage` enum is now exported
* Several user-facing errors were converted from `Error` to `ZWaveError` in order to be consistent with other errors.
* Warnings about insecure communication with a node because of missing security configuration are now emitted as `ZWaveError`s with code `ZWaveErrorCodes.Controller_NodeInsecureCommunication`

### Changes under the hood
* Changed how the transaction creation stack is included in error logs

## 5.3.0 (2020-10-10)
### Features
* Transactions now remember where they were created. This can be used to track down unhandled transaction rejections.
* When a message should be sent to a node that is assumed to be dead, the node is now pinged first to check if it is really dead.
* If a device supports `Notification CC` but sends `Alarm CC` (V1) frames, those are treated as `Notification Report`s if possible.

### Bugfixes
* The value IDs controlling `Start/Stop Level Change` commands in the `Multilevel Switch CC` are now also created for V1 and V2 nodes during the interview
* The `Alarm Sensor CC` value IDs for supported sensor types are now created as soon as they are known to be supported.

## 5.2.2 (2020-10-05)
### Config changes
* Added `Electronic Solutions DBMZ EU`

### Bugfixes
* Fixed a crash when receiving truncated messages
* When an unexpected error occurs while executing API commands (e.g. `Security CC requires a nonce to be sent!`), the corresponding transaction is now retried or rejected instead of crashing the driver.
* Nodes are sent to sleep again when they have no pending messages
* Compat queries are removed from the queue when a node goes to sleep
* Pending pings are resolved when a node wakes up
* `sendNoMoreInformation` now continues to work after it failed once
* `WakeUpCC::NoMoreInformation` is no longer moved to the wakeup queue when a node falls asleep

### Changes under the hood
* Removed some unused code

## 5.2.1 (2020-10-03)
### Bugfixes
* Fixed a crash while trying to determine the notification mode of a node
* Fixed a crash while defining metadata for a non-idle notification value

## 5.2.0 (2020-10-01)
### Features
* It is now possible to add an expiration timeout to sent messages by using the `expire` option for `sendMessage`.
* `Security CC` now stores unsolicited nonces as "free" and tries to use free nonces instead of requesting a new one if possible.
* Several improvements to `Notification CC`:
  * The interview now detects whether a node is push or pull
  * Push nodes now have their supporting values set to idle if no value is yet known
  * Pull nodes are now auto-refreshed every 6 hours and on wakeup

### Bugfixes
* During secure inclusion, the timeouts required by the Z-Wave specs are now correctly enforced
* When starting a network heal, the `"heal network progress"` event is now emitted immediately with the initial progress.
* Fixed a crash that could when queueing handshake messages while controller messages are pending
* `Thermostat Setpoint Set` commands now use the device-preferred scale instead of defaulting to the first one.
* A couple of `Notification CC` variables were changed to not have an idle state

### Changes under the hood
* Formatting log messages has been simplified. Log messages are now defined as objects and the log formatter auto-aligns the values.
* All remaining CCs had their log representation improved. If an error occurs during this conversion, this error is now caught.
* Code cleanup: TODOs, useless string interpolations
* Updated a bunch of dependencies

## 5.1.0 (2020-09-28)
### Features
* Added support for `User Code CC V2`
* All timeouts and the number of retry attempts are now configurable through the `Driver` options.

### Bugfixes
* Nodes are now only marked as dead or asleep if the controller receives no ACK for the sent messages. Missing responses to potentially unsupported requests no longer change the node status.
* `SendSupervisedCommandOptions` now correctly extends `CommandOptions`
* Timeouts configured through `Driver` options are now respected correctly

## 5.0.0 (2020-09-25)
### Breaking changes
* The status `Alive` was added to the `NodeStatus` enumeration. The node status can no longer switch between all states, only between `Dead` and `Alive`, between `Asleep` and `Awake` and from and to `Unknown`.
* The `status` property on `ZWaveNode` is now readonly. To change the status, use the `markAsAsleep` and similar methods, which only change the status if it is legal to do so.
* Unsolicited commands are now discarded in accordance with the Z-Wave specs if they are unencrypted but the CC is supported secure only
* `driver.start()` now throws if no handler for the `"error"` is attached

### Features
* A new method `withOptions` was added to `CCAPI`, which controls the used `SendCommandOptions`. For example, this allows changing the priority of each API call for that instance.
* All interview messages now automatically have a lower priority than most other messages, e.g. the ones created by user interaction. This should make the network feel much more responsive while an interview process is active.
* The node events `asleep`, `awake`, `alive` and `dead` now include the previous status aswell.
* Added the method `isEncapsulatedWith` to `CommandClass` to perform checks on the encapsulation stack.
* In addition to serial ports, serial-over-tcp connections (e.g. by using `ser2net`) are now supported. You can connect to such a host using a connection string of the form `tcp://hostname:port`. Use these `ser2net` settings to host a serial port: `<external-port>:raw:0:<path-to-serial>:115200 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT`

### Bugfixes
* Improved performance of reading from the Value DB
* Retransmission of commands now distinguishes between errors on the controller side and missing responses from nodes
* If a node that is known to be included securely does not respond to the `Security CC` interview, it is no longer assumed to be non-secure
* If a node that is assumed to be included non-securely sends secure commands, it is now marked as secure and the interview will be restarted
* The interview for sensor-type CCs is now skipped if a timeout occurs waiting for a response. Previously the whole interview was aborted.
* `Basic CC` values that are mapped to `Binary Switch` or `Binary Sensor` are now interpreted correctly.
* Fixed a crash that could occur when assembling a partial message while the driver is not ready yet.

### Changes under the hood
* The driver has been completely rewritten with state machines for a well-defined program flow and better testability. This should solve issues where communication may get stuck for unknown reasons.
* A node's `status` and `ready` properties are now managed by state machines to have better control over how and when the status changes.
* Enabled the TypeScript option `strictFunctionTypes` and the usage of several decorators is now statically enforced
* Added more fine-grained control over expected responses, and distinguish between responses, callbacks and node updates for sent messages.
* Many CCs had their log representation improved. If an error occurs during this conversion, this error is now caught and logged.

## 4.2.1 (2020-09-10)
### Config changes
* (Mojito-Joe) Added a configuration file for `ABUS CFA3010`.

## 4.2.0 (2020-09-04)

## 4.0.1 (2020-06-26)
### Breaking changes
See "Changes under the hood". I don't expect anything to break, but to be safe, I'll declare this as a major version.

### Bugfixes
* It is now assumed that the Basic CC API is always supported

### Features
* Mandatory supported CCs that are defined in the device class config are now respected. This should improve support for legacy devices that don't include all CCs in the NIF.
* Added support for `Sound Switch CC`
* Added support for `Alarm Sensor CC`. This CC will only be interviewed if `Notification CC` is not supported.
* Added a `sendReport` command to the `Notification CC` API, which can be used to send custom `NotificationCCReport`s.

### Changes under the hood
* Moved the definition of legacy Z-Wave device classes to a config file.
* This project has been converted to a monorepo and split into the following packages:
  * `zwave-js`: As before, this is the main entry point for consumers
  * `@zwave-js/config`: The configuration files and methods to access them
  * `@zwave-js/core`: The core modules, which are shared between `zwave-js` and `@zwave-js/config`
  * `@zwave-js/serial`: A lightweight wrapper around `node-serialport` with a built-in parser for received serial API messages
  * `@zwave-js/shared`: Utility methods that are shared between all other packages
  
  It is likely that other packages will be added in the future.

## 3.8.5 (2020-06-18)
### Bugfixes
* Overlapping `SendData(Multicast)` commands are now avoided
* `SendData(Multicast)` commands without a callback are now aborted after a while

* The `CRC-16 Command Encapsulation CC` is now correctly detected as implemented
* If an association group is configured to use node associations, the `Multi Channel Association CC` version heuristic is now ignored

### Changes under the hood
* Added some details to the `Multi Channel Association CC` interview logging

## 3.8.1 (2020-06-16)
### Bugfixes
* Associations to the controller are not checked for supported CCs anymore
* `addAssociations` now respects the `noEndpoint` flag
* Removing multi channel endpoint association to the root endpoint no longer removes the equivalent node association
* `getAllDestinationsCached` no longer treats node id associations like multi channel associations to endpoint 0

## 3.8.0 (2020-06-16)
### Features
* Added the `noEndpoint` flag to force lifeline associations to use node id associations
* The `Multi Channel Association CC` interview now falls back to setting associations with `Association CC` if the node does not accept the added associations

### Config changes
* Changed `AEON Labs ZW095` lifeline to a node id association
* (nicoh88) Added config files for Devolo Dimmer (MT2760) and Shutter (MT2761)

## 3.7.9 (2020-06-16)
### Bugfixes
* Logfiles are created again when the `LOGTOFILE` env variable is set after the library was imported

## 3.7.8 (2020-06-16)
### Bugfixes
* If a configured lifeline association is outside the range of multi channel associations, a normal association is now used instead
* The `Association CC` interview now always requests the group count, even if `Multi Channel Association CC` is supported
* `getAssociations` and `getAssociationGroups` now respect all associations (the ones done with `Multi Channel Association CC` and the ones done with `Association CC`).

## 3.7.7 (2020-06-15)
### Bugfixes
* Logfiles now contain all logs in the correct order
* Fixed an error when using the DoorLockCC setValue API when not all configuration values have been received
* Errors in the async part of handleFirmwareUpdateGet are now caught and logged
* When a non Z-Wave serialport is configured or loading the configuration files, the `"error"` event is now emitted and the driver is destroyed instead of crashing
* If a `MultiChannelCCEndpointFindReport` does not contain any bytes for the found endpoints, the CC is no longer discarded. This should improve compatibility with some devices, e.g. _TKB Home TZ74 Dual Switch_.

### Changes under the hood
* Removed some unnecessary logging

## 3.7.6 (2020-06-15)
### Bugfixes
* Fixed a crash that happens when receiving a `Multi Command CC`

## 3.7.5 (2020-06-14)
### Bugfixes
* Removing a multi channel endpoint association to the root endpoint now also removes the equivalent node association (REVERTED in v3.8.1)

## 3.7.4 (2020-06-14)
### Bugfixes
* Improved logging for `Multi Channel Association CC`
* Assembling partial CCs now works if there are multiple levels (e.g. Security CC -> Multi Channel Association Report)

## 3.7.3 (2020-06-14)
### Bugfixes
* Logging for the following CCs has been improved:
  * `MultiChannelCCCommandEncapsulation` - The source endpoint was added
  * `SupervisionCCGet` and `SupervisionCCReport` - Added parameter logging

## 3.7.1 (2020-06-12)
### Bugfixes
* `node.refreshInfo` no longer causes an event to be emitted for every cleared value
* `node.refreshInfo` resets the state of the `ready` event and all cached CCs and API instances

## 3.7.0 (2020-06-11)
### Bugfixes
* The compat queries for Danfoss thermostats now query setpoint 1
* Always send pings, even if the target node is asleep
* Several report-type commands now correctly store their values in the value DB when received
* `MultiChannelCCV1Get` now checks whether the returned `MultiChannelCCV1Report` is for the correct endpoint

* Lifeline reports for the root endpoint are now mapped to Endpoint 1 if the node supports Multi Channel Association CC in V1 or V2
* `ZWaveNode`s now have a `refreshInfo` method which resets all known information and restarts the node interview
* The node interview is no longer aborted if a response for the following requests times out:
  * Battery status
  * Battery health
  * Binary Sensor status
  * Multilevel Sensor status

### Changes under the hood
* Added `driver.waitForCommand` method to expect receipt of a command that matches a given predicate
* Added `driver.computeNetCCPayloadSize` method to compute how many payload bytes can be transmitted with a given CC (taking encapsulation into account).
* During build, CCs constructors for report-type commands are now checked if they call `persistValues`. Application CCs that don't will cause an error, all others a warning.

## 3.6.4 (2020-06-04)
### Bugfixes
* `Thermostat Setpoint Set` has been removed from the compat queries for Danfoss thermostats, because it overwrites queued commands

## 3.6.3 (2020-06-03)
### Bugfixes
* Always send handshakes replies, even if the target node is asleep

## 3.6.2 (2020-06-03)
### Bugfixes
* "Not implemented" or "Invalid payload" errors that happen while merging partial CCs are now correctly handled

## 3.6.1 (2020-06-03)
### Bugfixes
* `GetNodeProtocolInfoRequest` is no longer treated as a message to a node
* When moving messages to the wakeup queue, all pings are now rejected instead of only the pending ones. This avoids interviews getting stuck on a ping.

## 3.6.0 (2020-06-02)
### Features
* Added support for `Protection CC`
* The driver now sends a nonce in reply to `SecurityCCCommandEncapsulationNonceGet` commands

### Bugfixes
* Nodes that ask for a nonce are now automatically marked secure
* Fixed the computation of the authentication code when secure auth data length was a multiple of 16 bytes.
* Nonces are now marked as used immediately after (de)serialization
* If a message fails to serialize, the corresponding transaction is now rejected instead of crashing the driver
* Sequenced S0 encapsulated commands can now be received
* Unsolicited commands are now correctly decoded if they are split across multiple messages

## 3.5.5 (2020-06-01)
### Bugfixes
* The `Security CC` interview no longer stalls the interview process if the node is not included securely.
* Nonces that could not be sent are now expired immediately
* The security status of nodes is now stored and updated correctly

## 3.5.4 (2020-05-30)
### Bugfixes
* The driver now correctly handles nested transactions and their retransmission (e.g. for security encapsulated messages)

### Changes under the hood
* Updated TypeScript to v3.9
* Updated ESLint to v7, some changes to lint rules

## 3.5.3 (2020-05-27)
### Bugfixes
* All emitted `"error"` events now correctly contain an `Error` instance as the parameter.
* When a node sends a NIF, pending pings are resolved. This should increase the consistency of manually waking up nodes during the interview.
* When an interview is cut short due to missing network key, the `"error"` event is only emitted once.
* When a node is removed, its interview process is canceled and all errors are suppressed.
* If `Multi Channel Association CC` is V1, removing all destinations from all groups now correctly loops through all groups instead of using `0` as the group id.

## 3.5.2 (2020-05-27)
### Bugfixes
Various fixes related to `Security CC` when the network key is not configured. This means that the driver will not crash but likely there's no meaningful communication with secure nodes possible:
* The list of securely supported commands is not requested
* `Nonce Get` requests are not answered
* CCs are no longer encapsulated securely. This means that the interview for battery-powered nodes won't complete if `Wake Up CC` is only supported securely.

## 3.5.1 (2020-05-25)

## 2.12.0 (2020-01-25)
### Features
* When a node is removed from the network, all associations to it are also removed

## 2.11.0 (2020-01-21)
### Features
* Implemented the `Supervision` CC. The `Driver` now has two additional methods to make use of that feature:
    * `sendSupervisedCommand()`: Sends a command to a node using supervision and returns with the reported status (success, working, fail). This method throws if `Supervision CC` is not supported.
    * `trySendCommandSupervised()`: Convenience wrapper around `sendSupervisedCommand` and `sendCommand`. Automatically determines whether supervision is supported. Returns the supervision status if it is, and nothing otherwise
* The `Multilevel Switch CC` now makes use of supervised set commands if possible.

### Bugfixes
* Messages to sleeping nodes are now correctly de-prioritized when the awake timeout elapses
* Messages are now automatically re-transmitted when the controller responds with a `NAK` or when it fails to respond at all

## 2.9.1 (2020-01-07)
### Bugfixes
* `Notification CC` Reports that are received as a response during the interview are now correctly handled
* The `ready` event is now only for nodes that are known to be alive or asleep
* After `removeFailedNode()` has succeeded, the node is removed from the driver and the corresponding events are emitted
* The `alive`, `awake` and `dead` events are now also emitted for nodes if their status was previously unknown.
* After a node was removed or marked as dead, the check for `all nodes ready` is performed again
* Dead nodes are ignored in the check for `all nodes ready` to avoid the necessity for physical user interaction

## 2.9.0 (2020-01-05)
### Features

## 2.5.0 (2019-12-30)
### Features
* Added the event `"ready"` to `ZWaveNode` and `"all nodes ready"` to `Driver` to notify users that a node respectively all nodes are safe to be used

### Bugfixes (or maybe it's a feature?)

## 2.4.0 (2019-12-17)
### Features
* The log output now contains the version of this library (and a fancy title!)
* Reworked the `healNetwork` process:
    * The controller now has two additional methods: `beginHealingNetwork` and `stopHealingNetwork`. The original `healNetwork` now simply calls `beginHealingNetwork` and is deprecated.
    * Two additional events (`heal network progress` and `heal network done`) are emitted during the process. The event callback receives a map with the current process: *node id* (`number`) => *heal done* (`boolean`).
* Pending messages are now automatically removed from the send queue if they no longer serve a purpose (e.g. node removed or healing process stopped)
* The status of sleeping nodes is automatically reset to `asleep` 10 seconds after the wake up or the last completed transaction.

### Bugfixes
* Config parameters are no longer queried multiple times if there are partial config params defined
* If a ping failed and the node's messages are moved to the wake up queue, the send queue is no longer stalled by the unanswered ping
* When sending a message to a node that is known to be asleep, the message's priority is automatically set to `Wake Up` (except for `NoOperationCC`s).

* Using the env variable `LOGTOFILE=true`, the log output can now be redirected to a file instead of `stdout`.

### Bugfixes
* Updated `alcalzone-shared` lib to a working version
* The parameter number during interview of `Configuration CC` is now logged correctly instead of `[object Object]`.

### Changes under the hood
* Updated several dependencies

## 2.2.1 (2019-12-13)
### Bugfixes
* Removed deadlocks that happened when stopping the inclusion or exclusion process
* The start and stop of an in- or exclusion process is now correctly announced using the `inclusion started`, `inclusion stopped`, `exclusion started` and `exclusion stopped` events.

### Bugfixes
* Accessing a node's or endpoint's `commandClasses` property with `Symbol`s no longer causes a crash
* Revised querying logic for devices without Z-Wave+ or Lifeline associations

### Features
* Added support for `Indicator CC`

## 2.1.1 (2019-12-07)

## 2.1.0 (2019-12-01)
### Features
* Added support for `Meter CC`

### Bugfixes
* Fixed a crash that happened when setting a configuration value that would not fit in the configured value size by marking many configuration parameters in device config files as unsigned.

### Changes under the hood
* The min/max value for configuration parameters in device config files is now validated

## 2.0.1 (2019-11-27)
### Bugfixes
* Fixed a crash that happened when saving the network cache with a CC that is neither supported nor controlled

### Changes under the hood
* Errors in stack traces are now mapped to the original TypeScript sources.

## 2.0.0 (2019-11-26)
### Changes for users
* The `value updated` event is no longer emitted for `interviewComplete` every time a command is received

* If a node only controls a CC, the corresponding CCAPI is no longer falsely offered
* The driver no longer overrides the CC version that was determined by the CC constructor
* `Binary Sensor CC` is now correctly interviewed
* Added a large amount of device configuration files. This powers the `Configuration CC` for versions <3 and enables lifeline associations for devices that don't support the Z-Wave+ standard.
* Renamed a few manufacturers
* When devices wake up that neither support Z-Wave+ nor have a lifeline association, all sensor and actuator CCs are queried for updated values

### Bugfixes
* `Multi Channel CC` no longer queries endpoint #0 if EndpointFind returns no results or only zeroes.
* When values and metadata are deserialized from the cache, no more events are emitted. If you relied on this behavior, use `getDefinedValueIDs()` instead **after** the interview was completed.

### Breaking changes
* Added a new member to `ValueID`: `property` (`number | string`) replaces `propertyName` as the property identifier. `propertyName` is now in line with `commandClassName` and `propertyKeyName` and contains a speaking representation of the property
